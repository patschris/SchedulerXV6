# Scheduler xv6
## Xv6
Xv6 is a teaching OS that developed by people in MIT. It is a reimplementation of Unix v6, implemented for a modern x86−based multiprocessor using ANSI C, in order to give a good idea on how the operating system works. The source files of xv6 is provided as a printed booklet with line numbers in [\[1\]](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2017/xv6/xv6-rev10.pdf). To take an idea on which are the main concepts of operating systems by studying the kernel are explained, see [\[2\]](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2017/xv6/book-rev10.pdf). Understanding xv6 is a good start toward understanding modern operating systems. To install xv6 OS download the code from github, see [\[3\]](https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-public). Then, run the makefile. To run xv6, we need an emulator, called QEMU (see [\[4\]](https://www.qemu.org/index.html)). You can install the emulator with the following terminal command: `sudo apt-get install qemu`. After the installation, run `make qemu-nox`. Now, we are ready to use xv6 OS.

## Min-heap scheduler
A [heap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_(data_structure)) is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property: if P is a parent node of C, then the key (the value) of P is either greater than or equal to (in a max heap) or less than or equal to (in a min heap) the key of C (see [\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_(data_structure))). Our goal is to construct a min-heap scheduler to replace xv6's scheduler. This structure will be used as a priority queue for the timescheduling of the system's processes. That is, every heap's node will represent a process in READY state and its current priority. When the OS wants to pick a process to run (state: READY→RUNNING), the process with the lowest priority will be chosen (min-heap's root). The min-heap will have no more than 64 nodes. The priority of a process will be calculated as follows: \
![priorityFormulaImage](https://github.com/patschris/SchedulerXV6/blob/master/priorityFormula.png) \
where *runningTime*: total time that the process ran and used the cpu and *currentTime - creationTime*: total time that a process exists in the system after the time that it was created. \
When a process finishes a time-slice, but it's not done, we reinsert the process into the heap (READY state) with a new priority calculated by the above-mentioned formula. \
The construction of the min-heap node is based on [\[6\]](http://robin-thomas.github.io/min-heap/)

## System call printRunningProc
This system call prints all the information about the alive processes (READY, RUNNING, BLOCKED). The information that will be printed is:
* Process ID
* Process Name
* Parent process ID
* State
* Running time
* Process scheduled times


## Workloads
We made 5 small executable programs in order to test our scheduler: 
1. The fist program does multiple computations iteratively.
2. The second program does short and iterative I/Os. Specifically, read and write character by character.
3. The thrird program is similar to the second, but it reads a few thousand characters per I/O.
4. The fourth program is similar to the second, but it does multiple computations between the I/Os.
5. The fifth program is similar to the fourth, but it reads a few thousand characters per I/O.

## Makefile
We had to make some changes in order to include the newly created files.

## Files
In this repository, you can see only the files that I have changed in xv6 implementation and the newly created files. To test the scheduler you have to download the xv6 source code and move this source code inside the xv6 folder.
